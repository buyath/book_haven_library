For a library management system, you may not need APIs, but using them can make your project more robust, scalable, and realistic. Here’s a breakdown of how APIs can enhance certain features and when you might want to use them:

1. Authentication API
Purpose: Handle user registration, login, and logout.
Solution: Firebase Authentication API or a similar authentication API can handle user management securely, saving time and effort compared to building your own.
Alternative: If you’re storing user data in a JSON file or local storage, you can skip an authentication API, but it won’t be as secure or scalable.
2. Book Data Storage API
Purpose: Store, retrieve, and manage book information.
Solution: Firebase Firestore, MongoDB Atlas, or a RESTful API to manage CRUD operations for books.
Alternative: JSON Server can serve as a quick, local API solution to simulate data storage and retrieval.
3. Book Summary and Information API
Purpose: Display detailed book summaries, author information, and genre details.
Solution: Using a third-party book API, like the Google Books API or Open Library API, can provide rich data about each book, including summaries, author bios, and publication information.
Alternative: Manually entering book summaries and information in a database or JSON file, which is more work and limits data to what you enter.
4. User Actions (Borrow and Reserve) API
Purpose: Track user activities (borrowed books, reservations).
Solution: A simple API or Firebase Realtime Database to update book availability status and user activity data, making these interactions more dynamic.
Alternative: Storing this information in local storage (limited) or a JSON file.
5. Feedback and Reviews API
Purpose: Allow users to submit feedback and view reviews for books.
Solution: Firebase Firestore or a REST API to handle user feedback, where each book entry has an associated reviews collection.
Alternative: Hard-code a small selection of reviews, though this won’t allow for dynamic, user-generated content.
