For a beginner working on the simpler functionalities using JavaScript and Firebase, here's an estimated time breakdown:
1. Sign Up / Log In (Firebase Authentication)
Time Estimate: 6-8 hours
Tasks: Setting up Firebase Authentication, creating forms, and managing user sessions (sign-up, login, logout).
Challenge: You need to understand Firebase authentication, but once you get it, it becomes easier to handle.
2. Browse the Catalog for Books
Time Estimate: 4-6 hours
Tasks: Fetching data from Firebase and rendering the book list on the front-end.
Challenge: Connecting Firebase to your JavaScript and rendering the data dynamically on the page.
3. Search or Filter by Book Title, Author, or Genre
Time Estimate: 3-5 hours
Tasks: Implementing search functionality using JavaScript to filter books based on user input.
Challenge: Using JavaScript array methods like .filter() to filter book data and update the DOM.
4. View Book Details (Availability, Description, Author)
Time Estimate: 3-5 hours
Tasks: Fetching detailed information about a book and rendering it when a user clicks on a book.
Challenge: Linking the data correctly from the Firebase and displaying it dynamically based on user interaction.
5. View Borrowed Books
Time Estimate: 3-4 hours
Tasks: Displaying books that the user has borrowed, fetching this data from Firebase.
Challenge: Implementing a basic "borrowed books" list, but without the borrowing logic.
6. Manage User Profiles 
Time Estimate: 4-6 hours
Tasks: Allowing users to update their profile and storing this information in Firebase.
Challenge: Handling form inputs and updating Firebase records.
Total Estimated Time:
Approximately 23-34 hours

Why It Takes This Time:
Firebase Learning Curve: As a beginner, understanding how to connect JavaScript with Firebase and manage data can take a bit of time. But once you get used to it, it becomes easier.
Debugging: Youâ€™ll spend some time fixing eies involve manipulating the DOM to update the UI based on the data you get from Firebase, which takes some practice.
What Can Help:
Start by watching tutorials or reading Firebase documentation to speed up your understanding.
Break the project down into smaller steps so you can test and build functionality piece by piece.
If you focus on just the user functionalities (without admin), you can likely complete these simpler parts in 2-3 weeks if you spend a few hours each day.rrors, especially when integrating Firebase with your front-end.
DOM Manipulation: Most of these functionalit
